    "In this homework, we are focusing on answering some of the critical questions about data mining and data science in general. Some of the questions here are very popular interview questions you need to prepare. So take a coffee (or tea if you are a tea person), put on your thinking cap and start to crack these questions. Reviewing the lecture slides and the textbook will help you find some of the best answers. Each question is worth 10 points. \n",

    "Data mining could be looked at form either a commercial or scientific viewpoint. Froma  commercial viewpoint companies can collect data on users and then and use this data to provide more realivant searches to customers and also perform targeted advertising. From a scientific viewpoint data mining can help with automated analasys of massive datasets and in hypothesis formation, one example of this could be to use past data of MRI scans to have a model accurately determine medical differences.\n",

    "The pros of data mining include the ability to work to solve society's major problems like finding new ways to predict the impact of climate change or to find the best alternative energy solutions for specific areas. Also if a problem is worked through correctly, then the accuruacy that a model can produce may surpass the accuracy that a human can provide.\n",

    "The cons of data mining include the time it could take to find meaningful information from the large ammount of data availible. Another con is that there can be inaccuracies in the results especially if the data chosen is not cleand properly, which is a difficult task in it of itself."

    "One security concern for data mining is the data collection process. The person may not know what data is being collected or how it will be used and they have no opertunity to consent to this. A current solution to this is Apple implimentiing a privacy feature for applications on their app store in order to disclose this information and stop collection if unwanted.\n",

    "An ethics issue that companies face is deciding weather to tell a consumer that their data is being used for data mining. On one hand they can gain a advantage over the rest of the market by using this data, but they may also lose customer trust. Again a solution is implimentiing a privacy feature for applications on their app store in order to disclose this information and stop collection if unwanted.\n",

    "Answers: First I would look for null values and drop those rows. Then normalize the data. I would also look into EDA to draw conclusions on the data and look for corelations. This would be a classification problem. With this type of problem I could impliment K-Nearest Neighbours or  Decision Tree like I used in my DS200 final project. Because, this is supervised learning the preision and F1-score will be used to deterimne quality of model. This can then be applyed in order for all companies that use credit card transactions to run their data through and determine if a purchase is fraud. This problem sticks out to me because I use paypal as a way to recieve payments and they no longer offer fraud protection to their customers, so this would save me time and money."
